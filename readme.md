# RestAPI with Lumen

## Notice
When I want to make restAPI with Lumen, I found the a tutorial. You can see below link.<br />
https://devnotes.net/rest-api-development-with-lumen-part-one/ <br />
<br />
But there is problem. After I download and installed, It always outs <br />
{<br />
“status”: 404,<br />
“message”: “The requested resource was not found”<br />
}<br />
And there is some functions like a Mailing service that I don't use it.<br />
<br />
So I recreate the project step by step, finding a trouble.<br />
Finally It works!!<br />
It's helpful to follow the README in original project.<br />
